# AWG Obfuscation Parameters — Deployment Reference

This reference is specific to deployment-time decisions. For implementation/code-level details, see the project's `CONTEXT.md` and `.claude/skills/docker-amneziawg/references/awg-parameters.md`.

## Relationship to upstream Amnezia docs

The [official AmneziaWG self-hosted page](https://docs.amnezia.org/documentation/instructions/new-amneziawg-selfhosted/) deliberately publishes **no numeric defaults or constraint tables** — upstream expects users to install via the AmneziaVPN desktop app, which handles parameter generation invisibly over SSH. This Docker container reproduces that auto-generation logic explicitly, with the constraints documented below.

Practically: if a user is following upstream docs by hand, they'll have to fill in S/H/I/J values themselves. This skill should default to *not* asking them — the container will randomize on first boot. Only override if the user has a concrete reason.

## TL;DR for deploy

**The default behavior is correct for almost everyone.** If the user doesn't have strong opinions:

- Set `AWG_VERSION=2.0` (or omit — `2.0` is the default).
- Leave **all** `AWG_*` parameters unset in `docker-compose.yml`.
- The container generates valid random values on first start, respecting every constraint, and persists them to `/config/server/awg_params`. Restarts reuse the saved values.

Override only if:
1. The user is migrating from an existing AmneziaWG setup and needs to match its parameters.
2. The user wants to back up the compose file alone (not the `config/` directory) and have the same params on rebuild — pin the values in compose.
3. The user has a specific reason (custom CPS for a particular protocol disguise, matching a partner's setup, etc.).

## AWG 2.0 vs 1.5

| Feature | AWG 2.0 (default) | AWG 1.5 |
|---|---|---|
| S3/S4 | Random non-zero | Fixed 0 |
| H1-H4 format | Range pairs (`90666522-140666522`) — required for AmneziaVPN app to recognize as AWG 2.0 | Single integers (`90666522`) |
| I1-I5 | I1 auto-generated as QUIC Initial packet (RFC 9000); I2-I5 empty | All empty (disabled) |
| AmneziaVPN client | 4.8.12.9+ required | Any version |
| DPI resistance | Strong (mimics QUIC, randomized padding everywhere) | Weaker (no CPS, no per-packet padding) |

**Choose 1.5 only if** the user explicitly needs to support clients on AmneziaVPN < 4.8.12.9 — e.g., older Android devices stuck on an old Play Store version, or non-Amnezia third-party AWG clients that haven't implemented 2.0.

## Parameter constraints (full table)

All values are integers unless noted.

| Param | Range | Default (random) | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AWG_JC` | 1-128 | 3-8 | Junk packet count before handshake. Higher = more noise but slower handshake. |
| `AWG_JMIN` | 1-1279 | 40-80 | Min junk packet size in bytes. Must be < `JMAX`. |
| `AWG_JMAX` | 2-1280 | 80-250 | Max junk packet size in bytes. |
| `AWG_S1` | 0-1132 | 15-150 | Init packet padding. **S1 + 56 must ≠ S2** (otherwise looks like base WireGuard). |
| `AWG_S2` | 0-1188 | 15-150 | Response packet padding. |
| `AWG_S3` | 0-64 | 8-55 (2.0) / 0 (1.5) | Cookie message padding. |
| `AWG_S4` | 0-32 | 4-27 (2.0) / 0 (1.5) | Transport packet padding. **Per-packet overhead — keep small** (every data packet pays this cost). |
| `AWG_H1`-`H4` | ≥ 5 | Quadrant ranges (2.0) / single ints (1.5) | All four must be unique. Values 1-4 are reserved for standard WireGuard header types. |
| `AWG_I1`-`I5` | tag syntax string | QUIC Initial for I1 in 2.0, all empty in 1.5 | I1 must be set for I2-I5 to be meaningful. Tag syntax may contain `=`, parse with `cut -d= -f2-` not `-f2`. |

### Why the H constraint matters

When using AWG 2.0, the H1-H4 values **must use range format** (like `90666522-140666522`) for the AmneziaVPN client to identify the server as AWG 2.0. Single integers (legal in AWG 1.5) cause the client to report "AWG 1.5" and disables I1-I5 processing.

The container's auto-generator picks four non-overlapping ranges within the 32-bit unsigned space, one per "quadrant" of the value space. This is what you want.

### Why S1+56 ≠ S2 matters

The init/response handshake packets in WireGuard have a 56-byte length difference. If `S1 + 56 == S2`, the *padded* packets are the same size as the *unpadded* ones — which makes the obfuscation pointless because DPI can fingerprint the size signature. The container's randomizer avoids this collision; if the user supplies values manually, validate.

## Generating values manually

Use `scripts/gen-awg-params.sh` to produce a valid set. The script implements all constraints and prints the values as an env-var block you can paste into `docker-compose.yml`.

## When server and client values must match

| Param | Must match | Can differ |
|---|---|---|
| S1, S2, S3, S4 | ✅ Server and every client | — |
| H1, H2, H3, H4 | ✅ Server and every client | — |
| I1, I2, I3, I4, I5 | ✅ Server and every client | — |
| Jc, Jmin, Jmax | ❌ | ✅ Per-side (each side can have its own junk config) |

This is the "**redistribute every peer config**" footgun: if the user changes any of S/H/I after peers are already deployed, every existing peer config becomes invalid and needs to be re-issued. The container handles this correctly for newly-generated configs (they're built from the current `awg_params`), but old configs on user devices won't auto-update.

## Custom Protocol Signatures (I1-I5)

For AWG 2.0, the I1 packet disguises the first handshake as another UDP protocol. The container's default is a QUIC Initial packet (RFC 9000), which is a strong choice — QUIC traffic is extremely common and hard to block without false positives.

If the user wants to disguise as something else:

| Disguise | Where to get the CPS tag |
|---|---|
| QUIC Initial (default) | Auto-generated |
| DNS query | [AmneziaWG Architect](https://architect.vai-rice.space/) |
| DTLS / SIP / HTTP/3 / custom | [AmneziaWG Architect](https://architect.vai-rice.space/) |

CPS tag syntax:

| Tag | Description |
|---|---|
| `<b 0xHEX>` | Static hex bytes (e.g., `<b 0x170303>`) |
| `<r N>` | N random bytes (max 1000) |
| `<rd N>` | N random digits (0-9) |
| `<rc N>` | N random characters (a-zA-Z) |
| `<t>` | 32-bit Unix timestamp |

Example DNS query disguise (looks like a DNS request from a random source port):
```
AWG_I1=<b 0x0001><b 0x0100><b 0x00010000><b 0x00000000><rd 4><b 0x00000020><rc 8><b 0x076578616d706c6503636f6d00><b 0x0001><b 0x0001>
```

These are intentionally fiddly. **Don't ask the user to hand-write these.** If they want a non-default disguise, send them to the Architect web tool and ask them to paste in the resulting CPS string.
